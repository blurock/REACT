Installing REACT

0.  The sytem depends on two environment variables.  These must be 
      set up in the shell.  Both should be set to the location
      of the REACT system.  In bash these would be initialized with
       (if the system is in the directory /usr/share/REACT):
           export REACTROOT=/usr/share/REACT
           export CCROOT=/usr/share/REACT
           
1.  To compile the system and create the main executable bin/chemdb:
    from the main directory type
         make install

2. To initialize the runtime system and the database:
         make runsetup
         make database

3. At this point the system should be up and running.  Some useful
       scripts can be found in the directory:
           <REACT home>/programs/scripts
           <REACT home>/bin
   These should be added to the path
